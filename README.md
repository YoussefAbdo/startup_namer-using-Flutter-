# startup_namer

A simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates names. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.
Tapping the list icon in the upper right of the app bar navigates to a new page (called a route) that lists only the favorited names.
